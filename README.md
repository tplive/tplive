### Hi, I'm Thomas! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sort-of software developer, sort-of DevOpsy guy, sort-of a lot of things.

But one thing I'm  âœ¨ very much into âœ¨ is Open Source Software!

As such, I'm allegedly employed to develop mobile apps, while I covertly infiltrate my employer and my colleagues, secretly educating them on the virtues of contributing to OSS... ðŸ¤«

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on an Android mobile app for my employer, and very much invested in creating âœ¨ The Smoothest Development Workflow Known To Man (tm) âœ¨

ðŸŒ± In regard to above tasks, I'm currently busy studing the app as it exists today, as well as learning more Kotlin.

ðŸ‘¯ I'd love to collaborate on a few pet open source projects, namely:

- [Iskaribot](https://github.com/evry-ace/iskaribot/) (a bot that sends messages from Workplace to Slack, but can be extended to do a lot more!)
- [Comicbot](https://github.com/tplive/comicbot) (a bot that gets comics from a website and sends them to Slack)
- [qvidahl.no](https://github.com/tplive/qvidahl-no) (my personal home page)

Oh, and I want to start live streaming and talking about Git, so if you have ideas and/or want to take part somehow, please reach out! I have [an open repo for ideas here...](https://github.com/tplive/git-pod)

ðŸ“« You can reach me here on Github, obviously, and (in time) through my home page and also here:
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/qvidahl) 
- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/angounis)
